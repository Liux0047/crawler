This project contains the following folders:
MedusaRT/MultipleGPU/Tools - Medusa runtime, graph reader/partitioner, etc.
MBFS - Project folder for the multiple GPU BFS application
MPG - Project folder for the multiple GPU PageRank application
SSSP - Project folder for the single source shortest path application


How to build:
The application code is compiled with the Medusa runtime code. To compile, rename the
application folder to "Algorithm" and run "make" in the application folder.
Before make, change the "CUDA_SDK_PATH" and "CUDPP_PATH" in the make file.


How to write Medusa applications:
You can use one of the sample application folder as a template.
In this version of Medusa, you need to manually define you vertex, edge and message data structures in the following files:
    VertexDataType.h/.cu EdgeDataType.h/.cu MessageDataType.h/.cu
Then you need define your EMV APIs in UserOperator.h
Finally, you need to write the code to load graph from disk in main.cu. Our default graph reader reads graph file in the GTGraph generator produced graph format (http://www.cse.psu.edu/~madduri/software/GTgraph/index.html).
